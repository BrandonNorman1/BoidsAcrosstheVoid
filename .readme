## Unity Networked Boids ##

I used Zack Klinger's implementation of Boids along with Mirror networking to put this together. It was to answer "what if boids had to talk across a network" and "what if boids interacted with different 
packs of boids". Overall, nothing too interesting, unfortunately.
